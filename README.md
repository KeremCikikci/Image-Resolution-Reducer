# Image Resolution Reducer
This project is designed for the purpose of obliterating details or reducing the resolution of any given image as per user specifications. The application operates through the console, requiring the user to input the name of the image for which resolution reduction is desired. Following that, the dimensions of the parcels are specified. Each parcel of the image is then painted with the most dominant color in that area.

Key Functionality:

Console-Based Operation:

The application is command-line-based, offering a straightforward and efficient way to interact with the image resolution reduction process.
Customizable Resolution Reduction:

Users can tailor the reduction of resolution according to their preferences by specifying the dimensions of the parcels.
Color Dominance Painting:

Each parcel of the image is painted with the most prevalent color in that particular area, contributing to the reduction of resolution.
This project provides a unique approach to image manipulation and resolution reduction, offering a command-line interface for simplicity and efficiency. Explore and experiment with image processing using this open-source codebase available on GitHub.
